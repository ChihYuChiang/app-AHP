    STEP_4: "Acquire your AHP report.",
    INTERPRET:
      <ul>
        <li>Your report will be presented in a form of tree graph where each node represents a decision criterion. The nodes are connected to show their hierarchical relations. In addition, the <b>size of a node</b> represents how important is this criterion to the evaluation.</li>
        <li>The <b>Decision node</b> summarizes consideration of all criteria and is the summary of your report. Its color shows the <b>final recommended option</b> by the AHP for your underlying decision.</li>
        <li>Each color in the graph represents one option. The <b>color of a node</b> represents the dominant option regarding that particular criterion. In addition, the more <b>colorful</b> (less pale) a node is, the more dominant that dominant option is.</li>
        <li>Click the items in the <b>legend</b> to filter criteria by their dominant option.</li>
        <li>Move your cursor over a node, you'll see the actual <b>percentage</b> this criteria represents in the consideration, which is reflected in the size of the nodes. You'll also be able to observe <b>bar charts</b> that show each option's performance (in a percentage score) regarding this criterion. The option with the highest score will dominate (occupy) this node, and this node will be colored by the same color of that option.</li>

          Hierarchic is the first interactive implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analytical hierarchy process (AHP)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          AHP is a structured technique for complex decision makings. Developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Saaty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas L. Saaty</a>, it helps organizing and analyzing decisions especially of ones with manifold review criteria by mathematics and psychology. It is widely used in compounded business situations and complicated individual matters alike.
